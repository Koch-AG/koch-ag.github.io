### koch-ag.github.io
This repository contains the kochag _github-pages_ based website for public development projects,  
hosted at [koch-ag.github.io](koch-ag.github.io).   


#### Site structure
The site contains information and documentation files about all public projects and is split into multiple subdirectories representing the respective projects.  
Note: Since there's only one project as of now, the main index is just an auto redirect.
